## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The second assignment was to create a caster mount. The Base's dementions were 120mm x 120mm and 8mm thick. It has 4 holes 10mm in diameter and 20mm from the two clostest edges. It has one big whole centered on the origin and 30mm in diameter

### Reflection

This assignment was very similar to the base I learned about:
* The use tool (shortcut **U**)

Ohshape is awesome. I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Fork

### Description

The third assignment was to create a fork. I created the fork within the Base and mount sketch because they went together. The fork was an 80mm (diameter) circle extruded 8mm. two addition extructions were added on each face. A 40mm x 5mm rectangle 15mm from the origin and 20mm (diameter) cylinder. Rectagle was extruded 75mm and mirrored over the front plane. An additional 15mm (diameter) circle was added inside the previous 20mm circle and the 5mm difference was extruded 60mm. Fillets and chamfers were added to make the final look more poilshed

### Reflection

This assignent, while more difficult than the base or mount was still very easy. I learned about:
* Mirror 
* Fillet (shortcut **Shift-f**)
* Chamfer

Ohshape is awesome. I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Tire

### Description

The fourth assignment was the tire. This was the first part I made in a different part studio because it's dementions were not built off the others in any way.

### Evidence

### Reflection

This assignment was harder than the fork but still not difficult. In this assignment I learned:
* How to make a trapezoid 
* Revolve 

Ohshape is awesome. I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Wheel 

### Description

The fifth assignent was the wheel which is the support structure for the tire. It was built in the same part studio as the tire.

### Reflection

This assignment was the hardest of all the assginments. The dementions were weird and it took me a couple tries to figure out exactly what to do but it was still alright. In this assignment I learned:
* Construction Lines (**L + Q**)

Ohshape is awesome. I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description

The axel and collar were made as a seperate parts in a document, the bearings were made as a part of the tire and wheel, and the Washer was it's own part

### Reflection

These three parts were not so difficult as the wheel. In this assignment I learned:
* Symmetric Extrude

Ohshape is awesome. I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Sub-Assembly

### Description 

I assembled all the part studios into Sub-Assemblies. This included the three different part studios 
* [Base](#Base), [Mount](#Mount), and [Fork](#Fork)
* [Tire](#Tire), [Wheel](#Wheel), and [Bearings](#AxleCollarBearings)
* [Axle and Collar](#AxleCollarBearings)

### Evidence

* [Base Assembly](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/eb1ec979234123dfbac6cd01/w/f45771fda026ed7b0aa8d94f/e/14a2e6d3a86e87268065ea39)

### Reflection

This assignment introduced Mates which required a very long assignment to complete. Luckily mates are fairly easy in onshape even easier than other CAD programs. In this assignment I learned:
* Fasten Mate (**M**)
* Revolute Mate (also **M**)

Ohshape is awesome. I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
